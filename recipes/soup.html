<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>Melt butter in a large pot over medium-high heat. Stir in red onions, sweet onions, and<br>
        salt. Cook, stirring frequently, until onions are caramelized and almost syrupy, about <br>
        35 minutes. </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p> Stir in chicken broth, beef broth, red wine, and Worcestershire sauce. Bundle parsley, <br>
        thyme, and bay leaf with kitchen twine; add to the pot. Simmer over medium heat for 20 minutes,<br>
        stirring occasionally. Remove and discard herb bundle. Reduce heat to low; stir in vinegar and <br>
        season with salt and pepper. Cover soup and keep warm over low heat while you prepare the toast.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Arrange <br>
        bread slices on a baking sheet and broil, turning once, until well toasted on both sides, about <br>
        3 minutes. Remove from heat; do not turn off the broiler</p>
    </li>
    <img src="../img/soup/step_3.webp" alt="Step 3: Arrange bread slices">
    <br>
    <li>
        <p>Arrange 4 large oven-safe bowls or crocks on a rimmed baking sheet. Fill each bowl 2/3 full with<br>
        hot soup. Top each bowl with 1 slice of toasted bread, 2 slices Gruyère cheese, and 1/4 of the Asiago<br>
        cheese. Sprinkle a little bit of paprika over the top of each one. </p>
    </li>
    <img src="../img/soup/step_4.webp" alt="Step 4:Arrange bowls">
    <li>
        <p>Cook under the hot broiler until bubbly and golden brown, about 5 minutes. Cheese will cascade over <br>
        the sides of the crock and form a beautifully melted crusty seal as it melts. </p>
    </li>

        <p> Serve hot and enjoy!</p>
